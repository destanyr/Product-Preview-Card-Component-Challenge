## My process

So, I attempted to follow the proper process to creating one of these components. 
-I linked my css page
-separated my page into readable sections
-imported the font
-Centered the component on the page and added necessary CSS for placement, as well as color. 
-Afterwards I created the color transitions upon hover. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### Continued development

I will continue to be able to replicate designs until I feel comfortable with CSS and flexbox.

### Useful resources

MDN, as always.
